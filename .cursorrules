## 🛡️ MANDATORY: Development Process

**Before making ANY code changes, you MUST:**

1. **Document the issue** using `Documentation/ISSUE_FIX_TEMPLATE.md`
2. **Map dependencies** - What could break?
3. **Create test plan** - How to verify fix + regression?
4. **Get approval** - Review and approve approach
5. **Create checkpoint** - Use `npm run checkpoint "issue description"` or `.\scripts\create-checkpoint.ps1 "issue description"`
6. **Make isolated change** - Only what's needed, nothing else
7. **Test immediately** - Fix works + regression tests pass
8. **Commit or rollback** - Based on test results

**Reference Documents:**
- `Documentation/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` - Complete mandatory process
- `Documentation/FIX_WORKFLOW.md` - Quick reference
- `Documentation/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - One-page checklist
- `Documentation/ISSUE_FIX_TEMPLATE.md` - Issue documentation template

**This process is MANDATORY to prevent regressions. Never skip steps.**

## Code Quality Rules

- One issue = One branch = One fix
- Never mix fixes
- Never "improve" unrelated code
- Always test before and after
- Always create checkpoints before changes
- Always run regression tests

## When in Doubt

- Follow the process
- Document everything
- Test thoroughly
- Ask before proceeding if unsure
